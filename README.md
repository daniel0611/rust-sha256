# rust-sha256

This is a implementation of SHA-256/[RFC6234](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6234) in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). I've created this for educational purposes to learn more about the inner-workings of SHA-256, you SHOULD NOT use this for anything that is not completely irrelevant (aka. everything). If you are looking for a SHA-256 implementation in Rust that you actually want to use, check out the [sha2 crate](https://crates.io/crates/sha2).
